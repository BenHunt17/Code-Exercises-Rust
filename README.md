# Code-Exercises-Rust

A project dedicated to storing my own solutions and thoughts on a variety of coding exercises. Solutions are written in Rust.

To goal of this project if for me to continuously develop my problem solving skills.
I also hope to grow my understanding of coding and core computer science concepts.

Each solution is located in `src/bin`. The problem and its source is located at the top of the file. Any notes/thought processes are documented below the code

Steps to run a solution

1. Ensure that Rust and Cargo are installed https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Run the following command in the root directory: `cargo run --bin <solution>`
